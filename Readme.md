The files contain the code for cleaning, query concatenation and generating LSM values for the data. 

Step 1: Preprocess the data using the chunk clean file
Step 2: Run the files starting with query mask concatenation to generate files that are contain concatenated data specific to brand or influencer. You can then use the files as an input to LIWC22 software and get the LIWC values.
Step 3: Run the LSM code final to get the LSM values.(Need to input both the brands and influencers)

The other files are just used to check the number of rows, check cleaning functions and other small usages.
